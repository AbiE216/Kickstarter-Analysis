# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
  Louise came to us looking for assistance in analyzing data. She has written a play and is looking to use a kickstarter campaign to finance her play. Louise wanted to know how other kickstarters fared, and what they might have done to make them more or less successful. In order to provide her with this information, we used excel to analyze the data, and were able to construct visuals for Louise to decide the best path forward. 
  
### Purpose
  The purpose of our analysis was to provide Louise with a straightforward analysis of the data, so she could make an informed decision on how to proceed. 

## Analysis and Challenges
  This was a large data set to analyze with a lot of extraneous data. In order to get Louise a concise answer, the data needed to separated, altered, and filtered. We were given a lot of information, to move forward, we needed to know what data was relevant and what was not, the relevant data were, the goal amount, the pledged amount, the category and subcategory, the dates associated with production, the precentage funded, and most importantly; was it successful? To start, the category and subcategory were separated in order to isolate "Plays"; the dates of production were translated from Unix time stamps to the more colloqiually used month/day/year form. The date, and outcomes of the kickstarters were compared in the first line graph, shown below. The goal amount, the pledged amount, and the outcome of the kickstarters were analyzed together and a line plot was created to show the relationship, in the second graph shown below. 
  
  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
